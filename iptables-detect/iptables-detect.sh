# This script is only meant for use when operating in a non-containerized 
# environment but using non-host binaries (i.e. K3s with k3s-root), but 
# will fall back to operating in a containerized environment if necessary. 
# It relies on the underlying host system not having cgroups set up for PID 
# 1, as this is how it detects whether it is operating in a containerized 
# environment or not.

# Four step process to inspect for which version of iptables we're operating 
# with.
# 1. Detect whether we are operating in a containerized environment by inspecting cgroups for PID 1.
# 2. Run iptables-nft-save and iptables-legacy-save to inspect for rules. If 
# no rules are found from either binaries, then
# 3. Check /etc/alternatives/iptables on the host to see if there is a symlink 
# pointing towards the iptables binary we are using, if there is, run the 
# binary and grep it's output for version higher than 1.8 and "legacy" to see 
# if we are operating in legacy
# 4. Last chance is to do a rough check of the operating system, to make an 
# educated guess at which mode we can operate in.

# Bugs in iptables-nft 1.8.3 may cause it to get stuck in a loop in
# some circumstances, so we have to run the nft check in a timeout. To
# avoid hitting that timeout, we only bother to even check nft if
# legacy iptables was empty / mostly empty.
